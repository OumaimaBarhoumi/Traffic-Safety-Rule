This repository contains research and findings related to the integration of formal methods with Traffic Conflict Techniques (TCTs) for a rigorous analysis of vehicular crash severity. The primary goal is to verify the traffic safety rule using KeYmaera X (version 5.0.1). To accomplish this, we leverage the automated features and procedures offered by KeYmaera X for the verification.
